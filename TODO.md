Short Term:
* Write tests for everything
  - 'crappy tests' are now up to date
* Getting Ubuntu start-stop daemon working with files

Long Term:
* Turn the test.py into unit tests
  - Tear up/downs for PSQL/SQLite3
* Look into how it will interact with the frontend
  - What extra DB schema fields/tables will be required?
