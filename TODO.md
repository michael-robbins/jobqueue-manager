Short Term:
* Start coding the sync.py file
* Add support for media packages
* Run some basic tests for each class (if __name__ == '__main__': run basic test command and see)

Long Term:
* Write tests for everything
  - Start with db.py and the provided schema for SQLite3
  - Will turn the debug output when running libs interactively into unit tests
